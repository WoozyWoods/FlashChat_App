# FlashChat_App
 FlashChat is a fun Firebase messaging app. With this app I learned iOS and Android Firebase Flutter packages. The app registers and authenticates users with FirebaseAuth, saves data in the Cloud Firestore and listens for Firebase data with Streams. I also learned Dart mixins, Static Modifiers and custom animations with Animation Controller.
